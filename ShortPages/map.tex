        \begin{itemize}
            \item Measures the average precision calculated up to each position in the ranked list and averaged over all the users.
            \item The precision at position $n$ in the list is determined by a binary variable, $r_n$
            \item $r_n=1$ if the category of the recommendation at position $n$ is among the ones chosen previously by the user, $r_n=0$ otherwise
