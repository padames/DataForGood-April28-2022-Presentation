    \begin{block}{To capture patterns from how users interact with causes}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The set of transactions $\psi$ gets pre-processed into $\lambda$
            \item Then the set of features $\theta{}$ is computed
            \item Finally the set of implicit ratings, $r$, is generated
        \end{itemize}
